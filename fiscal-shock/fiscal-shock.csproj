<!-- Parent .csproj to keep code analysis, because Unity overwrites Assembly-CSharp.csproj whenever you add/remove a file

Usage:
  1. Generate Unity project (only do this once!); this makes the fiscal-shock.sln file and we're going to edit it
  2. Run the following command to add this to the .sln:
        dotnet sln add fiscal-shock.csproj
  3. Run the following command to remove the original .csproj, since it's included here:
        dotnet sln remove Assembly-CSharp.csproj
  4. Done! Don't ever regenerate the Unity project again, or you'll have to redo this. The .sln can't be versioned, because it generates GUIDs for each file.
