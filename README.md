# Team 12 - DMR Capstone

## Information
This is the capstone repository of Team 12, Spring 2020. Please use Unity 2019.3 for editing.

## Cloning
Please make sure to have your login information available when you clone the repository. It will ask you to login.

If you use the git CLI, please set up an SSH key following the instructions at the following link:
https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent. If you use Windows, you'll need git bash to do this.

## WARNINGS
- *In most cases*, the Unity project will not correctly pass the project to Visual Studio Code until you right click on any of the C# scripts and click "Open C# Project" in the context menu. Once Tiff's PR #71 goes through, please follow the instructions listed in Opening the Project for the First Time *only one more time*.
- Meta files get added for assets, scripts, *and* directories (folders). Please do not name two files or directories the same. If we end up with fragmented directories, we can always consolidate them later.

## Opening the Project for the First Time
Tiff has commented instructions for correctly setting up the project in fiscal-shock/fiscal-shock.csproj. Please read those instructions closely and follow them the next time you set up your project.

## Contributing
Please read the information in CONTRIBUTING.md before putting in a pull request. If you do not follow the rules, your build may fail and your pull request will be delayed until your contribution follows the rules.
