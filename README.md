# Team 12 - DMR Capstone

## Information
This is the capstone repository of Team 12, Spring 2020. Please use Unity 2019.3 for editing.

## Cloning
Please make sure to have your login information available when you clone the repository. It will ask you to login.

If you use the git CLI, please set up an SSH key following the instructions at the following link:
https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent. If you use Windows, you'll need git bash to do this.

## GitHub Large File Storage
GitHub's LFS is a way to store image files, 3D models, and other large files without placing them inside the repository. Please install GitHub LFS from https://git-lfs.github.com/ and follow Step 1 of the Getting Started section. This will prepare the repository for use with the LFS API.

If something seems to be missing or working strangely, attempt pulling the actual object from the GitHub LFS server using `git lfs pull`.

## Opening the Project for the First Time
Tiff has commented instructions for correctly setting up the project in fiscal-shock/fiscal-shock.csproj. Please read those instructions closely and follow them the next time you set up your project.

## WARNINGS
- Meta files get added for assets, scripts, *and* directories (folders). Please do not name two files or directories the same. If we end up with fragmented directories, we can always consolidate them later.

## Contributing
Please read the information in CONTRIBUTING.md before putting in a pull request. If you do not follow the rules, your build may fail and your pull request will be delayed until your contribution follows the rules.
