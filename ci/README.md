# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
The `.travis.yml`, several scripts in this directory, and the file `fiscal-shock/Assets/Editor/BuildScript.cs` were adapted from [Gabriel Le Breton's examples](https://gitlab.com/gableroux/unity3d-gitlab-ci-example/-/tree/master) (MIT licensed). Changes include setting the correct project path, changing the Unity version, and adding calls to scripts on failure. Most of the Travis configuration was rewritten from the original to suit our needs.
